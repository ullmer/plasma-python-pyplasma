This is all nicely packaged up with a propper setup.py script now.

Some interesting targets:
* build: Build, but don't install
* test: Run the unit tests
* doc: Build the HTML documentation (ends up in ./doc/_build/html)

TCP pools work like a champ, though TLS pools are not fully tested.

Local pools should mostly work, but they aren't nearly well tested enough,
so use at your own risk.  Resizing of local pools isn't implemented, but the
rest of the protocol should work.

There is a benchmarking script you can run to see how well this performs.
  python -m plasma.hose.benchmark (--help for options)

Also, while there are a number of bin scripts included with this release, none
of them are working yet.  In particular, don't try to use the tcp server
included with this release.

For a more complete rundown of what works and what doesn't, build the HTML
docs, and check out the index page.
